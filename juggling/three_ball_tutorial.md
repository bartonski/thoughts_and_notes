## Prerequisites

* The right juggling balls.
* Letting your arms hang
* The stall
* The egg beater
* Rhythm
    Use a three syllable word with hard consonants 'gig-a-bit'

## One ball

* Working with one ball is boring, but it's fundamental. It's also the easiest place to improve your technique.
* When you start juggling, warm up with one ball.
* If you're working on more advanced techniques and you start dropping a lot, put the rest of the juggling balls down, and toss one ball from hand to hand for a minute, then pick up the rest of the balls.

### Exersize 1

Pick up one ball and hold it in your dominant hand. Let your arms hang down at your sides, then bring both hands up with the palms facing upwards.

Right now, I just want you to watch me. I'm going to throw one ball from hand to hand. When I let go of the ball, you say *throw*. When I catch the ball in the other hand, you say *catch*.

*Toss*.

*Catch*.

*Toss*.

*Catch*.

Ok, good. Now I want you to do it with me:

*Toss*.

*Catch*.

*Toss*.

*Catch*.

### Exersize 2 -- Rhythm.

Now we'll use a three syllable word -- I like 'gigabit', because of the hard consonants --

*Gi* - *Ga* - *Bit*. throw on the first syllable:

*Gi* (throw)

*Ga*

*Bit*

*Gi* (throw)

*Ga*

*Bit*

*Gi* (throw)

*Ga*

*Bit*

*Gi* (throw)

*Ga*

*Bit*

### Exersize 3 -- Accuracy.

Your juggling throws must be accurate. Make a 'V for vistory' sign, then turn your hand palm up. Each ball should land just inside of the 'V'.

Try dropping a ball on that part of your hand, and you will find that your hand will reflexively close around the ball. Remember that feeling.

Drop your hands to your sides, bring them up to the start position. Move your catching hand a palm width to the side. Make a nice high arcing throw -- scoop - toss ... catch aim for the sweet spot of your hand. Try to re-create the feeling that you got when you dropped the ball into your hand. Go back and forth, dropping the ball on the sweet spot every time.

*Toss*.

*Catch*.

*Toss*.

*Catch*.

### Exersize 4 -- minimizing arm movement

Take a long soft cord, rope or belt -- karate belts work well. Tie it around your arms so that your upper arms can't move , but your forearms are unrestricted. Run through exersizes two and three immobilized by the belt. Put your feet together. Practice until you can make 100 consecutive throws, on beat, without moving your feet.

### Exersize 5 -- using a metronome.

In this exercise, I'll be using the [Soundbrenner metronome for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.soundbrenner.pulse&hl=en). It doesn't matter what you use, as long as you can set both the beats per minute and the time signature.
